# LoRaTrace RX — Progress Tracking

Living document. Update this alongside code changes — it's the "what's
actually true right now" source, `ROADMAP.md` is the "what's the plan"
source, `DESIGN.md` is the "why" source. Don't let them drift.

## Current status (2026-08-12)

Phase 0 (project scaffold) complete. Phase 1 (RadioLib bring-up, now
including optional SD-based channel config) code **confirmed to build
cleanly** (`pio run -e cardputer-adv`, `esp32-s3-devkitc-1`, RadioLib
7.7.1: 384KB flash / 20.6KB static RAM) but **not yet run on real
hardware** — this environment has no board attached. A clean build rules
out compile-time API mismatches; it says nothing about whether the SPI/I2C
wiring, register values, or radio behavior are actually correct. Treat
runtime behavior in `src/` as reasoned-through-but-unverified until
someone flashes it and reports back. CI now includes a rolling
`dev-latest` release for grabbing a Launcher-installable `.bin` without
tagging — see Decisions log.

## Build-order checklist

Mirrors `ROADMAP.md` phases / `DESIGN.md` §9.

- [x] **Phase 0** — platformio.ini, pin map, RF tables, phase-1 code, docs
- [ ] **Phase 1** — RadioLib bring-up (builds clean, hardware-untested)
  - [x] Confirm `pio run` builds successfully (312KB flash / 20.3KB RAM,
        `esp32-s3-devkitc-1`, RadioLib 7.7.1)
  - [ ] Flash to real Cardputer-Adv + Cap LoRa-1262 and confirm it runs
  - [ ] Confirm `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` board def actually matches this
        board's flash/pin config (no dedicated PlatformIO board def found)
  - [ ] Confirm PI4IOE5V6408 I2C address (0x43) and register map
        (0x03/0x05/0x07) against real hardware — sourced from a
        third-party driver, not the primary Diodes datasheet directly
  - [ ] Confirm FSPI is actually free (not claimed by the display bus)
  - [ ] Confirm RadioLib 7.7.x `SX1262::begin()` / `setDio1Action()`
        signatures match what's in `main.cpp` (pinned by `^7.7.1`, minor
        version drift possible)
  - [ ] Bench-verify RX against a known live Meshtastic LongFast (US)
        transmitter — RSSI/SNR should be plausible, not just non-crashing
  - [ ] Confirm SD-based channel config actually loads: drop
        `sd-template/loratrace/` onto the SD card with real values (e.g.
        MeshOregon's), confirm the boot banner reports the overridden
        channel, not the hardcoded default
  - [ ] Confirm PIN_SD_CS (12) + shared SCK40/MISO39/MOSI14 actually mount
        the SD card — now sourced directly from Cardputer-Adv + Cap
        LoRa-1262's own official docs/pin diagram (see DESIGN.md §7), just
        not yet bench-confirmed with real hardware
- [ ] **Phase 2** — task/queue architecture, GPS, SD, Logger (MVP-Beta)
- [ ] **Phase 3** — MeshCore profile
- [ ] **Phase 4** — `DISCOVERY_SWEEP`
- [ ] **Phase 5** — `ENERGY_SWEEP`
- [ ] **Phase 6** — UI polish, WiFi upload go/no-go

## Open questions (from DESIGN.md §7 — verify before / during build)

- [ ] Meshtastic's exact SX126x sync-word register value (sources
      disagree — pull from Meshtastic firmware source or RadioLib's
      Meshtastic-compat example)
- [ ] MeshCore's encryption/PSK scheme (don't assume it mirrors
      Meshtastic's default-channel PSK model)
- [x] microSD bus on this board revision — SPI, confirmed shared with the
      radio (not the display). **Finding (2026-08-12), well-sourced:**
      cross-checked M5Stack's official docs for both halves directly
      (Cardputer-Adv's own microSD pin table + the Cap LoRa-1262's own SPI
      pin table and printed pin-diagram image) — identical SCK/MOSI/MISO,
      distinct CS, and the Cardputer-Adv docs state outright that microSD
      shares pins with the EXT/Cap expansion connector. An initial hastier
      fetch of these same pages produced a scrambled, self-contradictory
      table (worth remembering as a caution about trusting single-pass doc
      scraping for anything pin-critical) — corrected via a stricter
      verbatim-quote re-fetch and a photo of the module's own diagram. See
      DESIGN.md §7 for the full note. Still not confirmed with an actual
      continuity/multimeter check on this board — that's the only thing
      left to close this out completely.
- [ ] Whether SD and the radio sharing one physical SPI bus needs explicit
      arbitration (e.g. a mutex around the shared `SPIClass`) once Phase 2
      makes both active concurrently across Core 0/Core 1 — the FreeRTOS
      queue moves the radio *task's* code off SD, but doesn't remove the
      electrical fact that two devices on one bus can't transact at the
      same instant. Not a Phase 1 problem (config load and radio.begin()
      happen sequentially in setup(), nothing concurrent yet) — flagging
      now so Phase 2's radio_task/logger_task design accounts for it.
- [ ] CAD `symNum` tuning — needs bench testing against Semtech AN1200.48
- [ ] 868–923MHz front-end rolloff near 923MHz — empirical RSSI floor
      sweep once hardware is in hand
- [ ] Exact per-slot frequency spacing for Meshtastic's 104 US slots —
      pull the real table from firmware source, don't infer from BW alone
- [ ] Real `ESP.getFreeHeap()` under load — every "no PSRAM" risk call in
      ROADMAP.md is provisional until this number exists

## Open questions — Launcher distribution

- [ ] Exact button combo for the manual-restart-into-Launcher path.
      Confirmed to exist (2026-08-12), specific keys not yet recorded —
      note it in this file once known, and consider printing it on the
      boot banner/UI so it's not tribal knowledge.
- [ ] How much flash Launcher's own footprint (bootloader + its app
      partition + any data/SPIFFS it keeps) leaves free for user-installed
      apps on an 8MB device, especially with multiple firmwares installed
      side by side. No documented number found — see ROADMAP.md
      Distribution section for the size budget reasoning used in the
      meantime.

## Decisions log

- **2026-08-12** — Board id: used `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` in `platformio.ini`.
  No dedicated PlatformIO board definition for Cardputer-Adv was found;
  this is what's used in practice by the M5Stack/ESP32-S3 community for
  this chip. Revisit if M5Stack ships an official board file.
- **2026-08-12** — Deferred creating `radio_task`/`gps_task`/
  `logger_task`/`ui_task`/`fingerprint.h` (CLAUDE.md's proposed layout)
  until Phase 2. CLAUDE.md's Status section explicitly says start with
  phase 1 bring-up "before touching the task/queue architecture" — the
  scaffold respects that rather than creating empty stub files now.
- **2026-08-12** — Added `src/board_pins.h`, which isn't in CLAUDE.md's
  proposed layout. Justification: DESIGN.md §1 already tabulates the full
  pin map as decided config, multiple future tasks (radio, GPS, logger)
  will need the same constants, and Phase 1 needs them immediately — a
  shared header avoids duplicating pin numbers across files as they're
  added in later phases.
- **2026-08-12** — RadioLib pinned to `^7.7.1` (latest release as of this
  session). PI4IOE5V6408 I2C address (0x43) and register offsets
  (0x03 direction / 0x05 output / 0x07 high-Z) sourced from ESPHome's
  component docs and a from-datasheet MicroPython driver, not the primary
  Diodes datasheet — flagged for hardware verification, not treated as
  ground truth.
- **2026-08-12** — Confirmed (user): returning from a Launcher-installed
  app to Launcher itself is a manual restart + button combo, not a
  software hook our firmware needs to implement. No return-to-launcher
  code needed in `main.cpp`/future `ui_task`.
- **2026-08-12** — Settings/config get persisted to a folder on the SD
  card, not flash NVS. Rationale: Launcher owns the flash partition table
  dynamically per installed app (see ROADMAP.md Distribution section), so
  a custom NVS/data partition isn't guaranteed to survive the user
  swapping firmwares. This is also just the existing DESIGN.md philosophy
  ("SD is the datastore, RAM is a relay buffer") extended to config, not a
  new pattern. No config schema/format decided yet — deferred until
  something actually needs to be configurable (Phase 2+ profile selection
  persistence being the likely first case).
- **2026-08-12** — Added `src/version.h` as the single source of truth for
  `FIRMWARE_VERSION`, printed on the boot banner. Added CI
  (`.github/workflows/build.yml`: `pio run -e cardputer-adv` +
  `pio test -e native` on every push/PR) and a tag-triggered release
  workflow (`release.yml`: `vX.Y.Z` tag -> builds, renames to
  `LoRaTraceRX-<version>.bin`, opens a **draft** GitHub Release — draft on
  purpose, since hardware verification is still pending and nothing should
  auto-publish yet). Added `[env:native]` to `platformio.ini` for
  host-based unit tests (no ESP32 toolchain needed) and a first real test
  (`test/test_channel_plans/`) validating the RF constants are in-band and
  don't collide — both verified to actually pass in this session, not just
  written. Note: `pio run` alone builds *all* environments including
  `native`, which has nothing to build outside `pio test` — always use
  `pio run -e cardputer-adv` (README/CI already do).
- **2026-08-12** — Added a rolling `dev-latest` release to `build.yml`:
  every push to `main` force-moves a `dev-latest` git tag and
  updates/republishes a prerelease at that tag with a fixed-filename
  binary (`LoRaTraceRX-dev.bin`), so there's always a stable, no-login
  download URL for SD-drop/Launcher testing without waiting on a version
  tag. Separate from `release.yml`'s versioned `vX.Y.Z` releases, which
  stay manual/deliberate. **Unverified**: this is the first time the
  workflow exists, so it hasn't actually fired on a real push yet — the
  `softprops/action-gh-release` update-in-place behavior for a re-used tag
  is a well-established pattern for this action, but confirm the first
  run actually updates `dev-latest` rather than erroring.
- **2026-08-12** — Added SD-based channel config
  (`src/config.h`/`config.cpp`, path `/loratrace/config.txt`,
  `sd-template/loratrace/config.txt` as the copyable example) so operators
  running non-default regional presets (e.g. MeshOregon) can override
  freq/SF/BW/CR without a rebuild. Scoped narrowly: one-shot boot-time SD
  read before `radio.begin()`, not the general Phase 2 settings/Logger
  architecture — this was pulled forward because it was blocking real
  testing tonight, not because Phase 1's scope changed otherwise. Values
  are bounds-checked (868-928MHz, SF5-12, CR5-8) and rejected
  field-by-field with a warning rather than applied blind, since a bad
  frequency/SF here means silently hearing nothing. Confirmed
  build-clean; SD mount itself is unverified pending the `PIN_SD_CS`
  hardware check above. This closes out the "no config schema decided
  yet" note in the previous entry.
- **2026-08-12** — Re-verified the SD/radio shared-bus finding against
  M5Stack's official docs directly (Cardputer-Adv microSD table + Cap
  LoRa-1262 SPI table, both re-fetched with a stricter verbatim-quote
  prompt after a first, hastier attempt produced a scrambled and
  internally-contradictory pin table — that error is worth remembering,
  not just fixing). User-supplied photo of the Cap LoRa-1262's printed pin
  diagram independently confirmed the SX1262 pins, the antenna-switch
  I2C address (0x43, now primary-source-confirmed, silkscreened on the
  module), and GPS UART pins. One correction found: DESIGN.md called the
  GPS chip "AT6668," official docs/diagram say "ATGM336H" — fixed, naming
  only, no pin/code impact. `board_pins.h` and DESIGN.md §1/§7 updated
  with the stronger sourcing.

## Next steps

1. Get this scaffold onto real hardware — planned route is SD-drop into
   an existing Launcher install (`LoRaTraceRX-dev.bin` from the rolling
   release) rather than direct USB flash, so it doesn't disturb the
   current Launcher setup. Serial monitor still works normally over USB
   for observing boot output either way. Resolve the Phase 1 checklist
   above, including the new SD-config items.
2. Once radio RX is confirmed live, empirically resolve the microSD bus
   question — it's the one Phase 2 blocker that can't be reasoned through
   from docs alone. Tonight's SD-config test is a first real data point
   for this even before Phase 2 starts.
3. Start Phase 2 (task/queue architecture) only after Phase 1 is bench-
   confirmed, per CLAUDE.md's explicit build-order instruction. Phase 2's
   radio_task/logger_task split needs to account for the shared-SPI-bus
   finding above, not just cross-core task separation.
